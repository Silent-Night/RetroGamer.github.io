RetroGamer is an Android Emulator Frontend for your Retro Game ROM Collection. It is not an emulator by itself but a frontend to host your retro game collection.

You can place and organize all your favorite childhood games in a folder on your phone. 
From there you will be able to choose which system and game you would like to play as well as
see its cover art and game description.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
